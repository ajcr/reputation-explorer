### Reputation Explorer

So you're active on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) or another site in the Stack Exchange network.

If you're curious, you can find a lot of data about exactly how you've accumulated reputation using Stack Exchange Data Explorer. However, data about when your reputation was gained or lost is not accessible here!
What do you do if, for instance, you want to see exactly how one of your answers have been voted on over time? This notebook shows a simple way to find, clean and then dig into this data using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).

Click [here](https://github.com/ajcr/reputation-explorer) to see the exploration in action.
